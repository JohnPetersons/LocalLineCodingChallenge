Local Line Coding Challenge

The challenge was to create something that looks like the two screenshots that populates the data from the promise returned by the APICall function in util.js.  Made with React.

To run create a new react project with "create-react-app localline-app" and then replace the public, and src folders with the ones in this project.
If you don't have create-react-app then you can install it with npm.
Run the site with the command "npm start".

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
